I would like to design a JSON parser.

What can this program do?
  - A bash command which takes the argument of a JSON file, and then creates a c file which declares the various fields 
  in the JSON file as c-compatible fields in a header/include file. 
  - Needs to be able to reliably read JSON formats, accounting for White Spaces and various character formats.
  - The file needs to be built ready to be included into your c project straight away.
